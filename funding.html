    <h2>About the NCV Graduates Entrepreneur Fund</h2>
    <p>
      In response to Kenya’s growing unemployment challenges, the NCV Graduates Entrepreneur Fund was developed to provide a pathway for young innovators to launch sustainable businesses. Recognizing that NCV graduates often lack access to financial backing or business mentorship, this initiative is designed to fill that gap.

      <li>Lack of accessible capital for NCV graduates with business ideas.</li>

    </ul>
